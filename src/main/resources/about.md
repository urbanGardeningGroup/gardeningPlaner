## Simple CRM

This is an example application generated by BlueMix boilerplate.

Features that you get when starting your application from this boilerplate includes:

 * The app uses a relational database for persistence, namely DB2 during deployment into BlueMix. Feel free to configure any RDBMS for local development.
 * The data is accessed through JPA and EJB using container managed transactions.
 * A rich HTML5 UI implemented with Vaadin Framework in plain Java for easy modification and maintenance. For more information and documentation on Vaadin see [vaadin.com](https://vaadin.com)
 * Built in mobile support, with responsive design.

*Note, setting up the database schema and test data may take a while on first run.*
